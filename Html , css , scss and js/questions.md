### Project Exercise 10: JavaScript Form Validation

- **Topic Covered:** JavaScript, HTML
- **Description:** Create a form that includes fields for name, email, and password. Write a JavaScript function to validate the form before submission. Ensure that the name field is not empty, the email follows a valid email format, and the password meets certain criteria (e.g., minimum length). If the validation fails, display an error message next to the respective field and prevent the form from being submitted. Style the form and error messages for clarity.
- **Skills Covered:** JavaScript form validation, regular expressions for email validation, handling form events, DOM manipulation, and displaying dynamic error messages.

### Project Exercise 11: To-Do List App with Event Handling

- **Topic Covered:** JavaScript, DOM
- **Description:** Build a simple to-do list application where users can add new tasks, mark them as complete, and remove tasks. Use JavaScript event listeners to handle interactions such as adding tasks when the user submits input, toggling task completion when clicked, and deleting tasks when a remove button is clicked. Dynamically update the DOM based on user actions to reflect the changes in the to-do list.
- **Skills Covered:** Event listeners, dynamic DOM manipulation, user interaction, and managing UI updates based on actions.

### Project Exercise 12: Button Animation with CSS Transitions

- **Topic Covered:** CSS. javascript ( optional )
- **Description:** Create a button that animates when clicked. Use CSS transitions to make the button grow when hovered over and shrink when clicked, providing smooth effects. Implement the animation using `@keyframes` and transition properties such as `transform` and `scale`. Ensure the animation is smooth and feels interactive for the user, with appropriate timing and easing functions.
- **Skills Covered:** CSS transitions, animations with `@keyframes`, transition properties like `transform` and `scale`, and smooth interactive effects.

### Project Exercise 13: JavaScript Object - Car Information

- **Topic Covered**: JavaScript.
- **Description:** Create a JavaScript object representing a car with properties such as `make`, `model`, and `year`. Display these properties dynamically in the browser by using `document.write()` or manipulating the DOM. Additionally, log the object to the console to showcase how to access and display object properties.
- **Skills Covered:** Working with JavaScript objects, understanding properties, methods, and how to log information to the console and display it on the web page.

### Project Exercise 14: Interactive Quiz App

- **Topic Covered:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM
- **Description:** Create a simple interactive quiz app that presents multiple-choice questions to the user. The user selects answers and submits the quiz. After submission, display the total score based on correct answers. Use JavaScript to handle user interactions, such as selecting answers and calculating the score. Manipulate the DOM to dynamically update the question and show the final score after submission.
- **Skills Covered:** DOM manipulation, event handling, JavaScript functions, conditionals for checking answers, and updating content dynamically.

### Project Exercise 15: Responsive Navbar

- **Topic Covered:** HTML, CSS
- **Description:** Design a responsive navigation bar that displays horizontal links on larger screens. When the screen size is reduced (e.g., mobile view), the navbar should transform into a hamburger menu. Use media queries to make the navbar responsive and flexbox for layout management. Ensure the hamburger menu is clickable, and when clicked, it displays the navigation links in a dropdown or slide-in style.
- **Skills Covered:** Media queries for responsiveness, flexbox for layout, positioning for menu items, and implementing responsive design techniques.

### **Project Exercise 16: Image Slider**

- **Topic Covered:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM.
- **Description:** Build an image slider that automatically cycles through a series of images every few seconds. Add next and previous buttons that allow users to manually navigate between images. Use JavaScript `intervals` to control the automatic image transition, and implement event listeners for the next/previous buttons. Apply CSS transitions for smooth image sliding effects. The slider should be responsive, adjusting to different screen sizes.
- **Skills Covered:** JavaScript intervals for automatic transitions, event listeners for navigation buttons, DOM manipulation for dynamic updates, and CSS transitions for smooth animations.

### **Project Exercise 17: Countdown Timer**

- **Topic Covered:** JavaScript, DOM
- **Description:** Create a countdown timer that starts from a specified time (e.g., 10 minutes) and counts down to zero. The timer should update every second and display the remaining time on the webpage. When the timer reaches zero, an alert should appear notifying the user that time is up. Use `setInterval()` to update the timer every second and `clearInterval()` to stop the countdown when it reaches zero.
- **Skills Covered:** `setInterval()` for periodic updates, `clearInterval()` for stopping the timer, time manipulation, and updating the DOM to display the countdown.

---

### **Project Exercise 18: Custom Modal Popup**

- **Topic Covered:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Description:** Create a custom `modal` popup that appears when a button is clicked. The modal should display a message or content and include a "close" button that hides the modal when clicked. Use JavaScript for event handling, such as showing the modal when the button is clicked and hiding it when the close button is clicked. Style the modal using CSS to ensure it is positioned correctly on the screen and is initially hidden.
- **Skills Covered:** DOM manipulation for showing and hiding the modal, event handling for button clicks, CSS positioning for the modal, and controlling visibility with CSS and JavaScript.

---

### Project Exercise 19: Local Storage To-Do App

- **Topic Covered:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Description:** Build a to-do list application that allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The tasks should be stored in the browser's local storage, ensuring they persist even after the page is reloaded. Use JavaScript to handle the creation and deletion of tasks, update the DOM accordingly, and utilize the `localStorage` API to save tasks. When the page is refreshed, the tasks should be reloaded from local storage and displayed.
- **Skills Covered:** Using `localStorage` for persistent data storage, DOM manipulation to dynamically update the task list, and handling user input with event listeners.

### **Project Exercise 20: Interactive Weather App**

- **Topic Covered:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM
- **Description:** Build a weather app that fetches real-time weather data from a public API (such as OpenWeatherMap) and displays it in a user-friendly interface. The app should allow users to search for the weather by city name. Use the Fetch API to request data, handle the JSON response, and update the DOM with the weather information (e.g., temperature, humidity, and conditions). Include error handling for invalid city names or network issues.
- **Skills Covered:** Using the Fetch API to retrieve data, handling JSON responses, DOM manipulation to display the weather data, and implementing error handling for API requests.
